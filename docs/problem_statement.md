# Problem Statement

Public grievance redressal systems rely heavily on manual processes
to read, categorize, and forward citizen complaints to the
appropriate departments.

This leads to:
- Delayed response times
- Incorrect routing
- Lack of prioritization
- Poor transparency for citizens

There is a need for an intelligent, automated system that can
analyze grievances in real time, prioritize them based on urgency,
route them to the correct department, and monitor resolution timelines.
